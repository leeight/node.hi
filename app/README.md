[从这里提取的内容](http://developer.chrome.com/trunk/apps/first_app.html)

### Enable flags

Many of the packaged apps APIs are still experimental, so you should enable experimental APIs so that you can try them out:

* Go to chrome://flags.
* Find "Experimental Extension APIs", and click its "Enable" link.
* Restart Chrome.

### Load your app

To load your app, bring up the apps and extensions management page by clicking the `settings icon`  and choosing `Tools > Extensions`.

Make sure the Developer mode checkbox has been selected.

Click the Load unpacked extension button, navigate to your app's folder and click OK.

### Open new tab and launch

Once you've loaded your app, open a New Tab page and click on your new app icon.
